            I have experience making games as well as interactive experiences.
            I am proficient with the Unity and Unreal engines, and am experienced with C# and C++ code.
            I have designed web pages, including this one, using HTML and CSS.

            Whenever I am not programming or gaming, I enjoy writing stories and thinking up
            new characters. I particularly enjoy framing potential character interaction or action scenes.
            You can always find a few scenarios banging around in my head.

            <strong>Doots Never Die</strong><br>
            Doots Never Die is a game made in Unity in fall 2021 by me and a team of RIT students.
            The game is a top-down shooter where you're fighting against the clock to
            scare as many kids as possible on Halloween night. The game was fully
            programmed in Unity and published to the web using the built-in webGL functionality.
            My role in Doots Never Die was on the enemy AI of the children in the game. I had
            to figure out how the enemies would react to the player's position at all times and 
            carefully balance their speed and aggressiveness to make the game challenging, but fair.

            <strong>Wilderwood</strong><br>
            Wilderwood is a 3D collectathon made in Unity by me and a group of friends. As lead UI
            Designer/Developer, I was in charge of prototyping and refining the look and feel of the
            our interface. The design is simple and rustic looking, which I thought best fit the
            elements of our casual experience, but after multiple iterations, it was also streamlined
            to give the player the information they needed without being too crowded and messy.

            <strong>Submerged</strong><br>
            Submerged is a game made in fall 2021 in Unity by me and a team of RIT students
            The game is a side-scrolling platformer that takes place entirely underwater.
            As a result, the movement is floaty and the character relies on a grappling hook for
            quick lateral movement and manuverability. The game was made in Unity using the WWIse
            sound engine. My role on Submerged was head level designer. I made levels that introduced
            and reinforced a core mechanic of the gameplay and was also key in asset creation for
            the look and feel of the game, like the backgrounds for the levels and menu.
